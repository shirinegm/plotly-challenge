# plotly-challenge

A Bootcamp Plotly challenge about displaying data around belly button biodiversity. It is an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Instructions

1. This code assumes D3 and Plotly dependencies.
1. The data is self contained in the repository.
